  [:p "I am a developer currently working at Raytheon in Tucson, AZ. I focus on
       full stack web development, but I am also beginning work on Hololens AR applications.
       I am passionate about environmentalism, science, programming, and literature. Lately, I've grown
       obsessed with the programming language " [:span link] " (this website was built with it!) 
       and functional programming in general. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing guitar, 
       losing at board games, or trying my luck in a harrowing dungeons and dragons campaign."])
